# Virtuwell

As a UX developer on Virtuwell, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that have improved the user experience and helped achieve business goals.

## Headless CMS Migration

One of the most significant projects I worked on was the migration of Virtuwell's marketing pages to a headless CMS. This involved re-architecting the existing pages to work with the new CMS and building out a new front-end to consume the API provided by the CMS. This migration has greatly improved the content management process, allowing for faster updates and a more streamlined workflow. It has also made it easier for the marketing team to create and manage content, resulting in more effective campaigns and better overall performance.

## NGRX Removal

Another project I worked on was removing the use of NGRX from a large portion of one of Virtuwell's applications. This has resulted in faster load times and improved user experience, as well as making it easier to maintain the application in the long run.

## Accessibility Improvements

I also worked on various accessibility improvements across Virtuwell's web applications. These include implementing keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and color contrast changes to improve the experience for users with disabilities.

Overall, I'm proud to have been a part of these projects and to have contributed to the success of Virtuwell's web presence. I look forward to continuing to help improve the user experience and drive business growth through innovative solutions and strategic design.
