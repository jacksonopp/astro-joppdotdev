# Topaz

As a front-end developer, I believe that consistent and reusable design patterns are crucial for creating a great user experience. That's why I took on the challenge of creating Topaz, an Angular library that streamlines the development process and ensures a cohesive and user-friendly interface for all of Pearson VUE's products.

Using Angular Material as a foundation, I built a customizable set of components that can be easily integrated into any project. The library includes everything from basic UI elements like buttons and inputs, to more complex components like data tables and modals.

<CldImage
  class="relative rounded-lg"
  src="portfolio/portfolio/topaz"
  alt="Topaz user interface"
  widths={[500, 1200]}
  ratio={[4, 3]}
  medias={["(max-width: 768px)", "(max-width: 1024px)"]}
  fit="fit"
/>

One of the biggest challenges of creating Topaz was ensuring accessibility and compatibility with assistive technologies. To ensure that all users can access and interact with the components, I meticulously tested and optimized each one for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

In addition to the technical aspects of the library, I also focused on the design and user experience of each component. I worked with Pearson VUE's design team to create a consistent visual style and ensure that the library adheres to the latest design trends and standards.
