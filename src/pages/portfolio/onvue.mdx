# OnVUE

OnVue is an online proctoring platform that allows users to take exams from the comfort of their own homes. As a UX developer on the OnVue team, I worked on several key projects to improve the platform's usability and functionality.

## SmartReview Dashboard

One of the main projects I worked on was **SmartReview Dashboard** an AI-powered dashboard that enabled proctors to review and analyze previous exams to detect any potential infractions. This dashboard was designed to allow proctors to review a single test at a time and used AI algorithms to identify any suspicious behavior. This project required close collaboration with the AI team to ensure seamless integration with the rest of the platform.

## A11y improvements

In addition to the dashboard, another one of my key contributions was improving the platform's accessibility by making sure that it met the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standards. This included enhancing keyboard navigation, ensuring proper labeling of form fields, and improving color contrast for users with visual impairments. I also conducted extensive testing with assistive technologies such as screen readers and made necessary adjustments to ensure a seamless experience for all users.

## Check-in Improvements

As part of my work on OnVUE, I also made significant improvements to the overall user experience. This involved analyzing user behavior and feedback, identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement, and implementing changes to make the platform more intuitive and efficient. One major area of focus was the exam setup process, where I worked to simplify and streamline the steps required for candidates to begin their exams. I also made changes to the navigation and layout of the platform to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing. Additionally, I implemented features such as progress indicators and clear feedback messages to provide a more seamless and reassuring experience for candidates.

Overall, I'm proud of the work I've done on OnVue and how it has helped to improve the user experience for both proctors and exam-takers. The AI-powered dashboard was a particularly challenging project, but I'm pleased with how it turned out and the impact it has had on the platform's functionality.
