### Information Architecture I specialize in organizing digital content to

make it easy to find and navigate through the creation of site maps,
wireframes, and other documentation.

### Front-end Development

I use the latest web development technologies to transform design concepts into functional, visually appealing interfaces.

### Accessibility Testing

I ensure digital products are usable by people all levels of ability by testing for compliance with web accessibility standards, such asWCAG 2.1, and identifying and addressing accessibility issues.
